# Database Management System for Ala Too Library on Javafx and Postgres
## Description:

This assignment is based on developing a Library Database using Java
Programming Language. For that I used Java GUI (Graphical User Interface) in this development so
that it is user-friendly to interact.
I also added Postgres database to store important data related to the project. 

### Set up tutorial (Check out The Creation Tutorial in the end):
Before executing this program, users need to do some works so that it will run properly into their
system. First, they need to make sure their system has “JDK”. If they don’t have it then
they can download from the below link: 
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html

Depending on their system (Windows 64bit/32bit) they need to download and install it. Then
they need to add the “JAVA” files to their system “PATH” so that the system can run the
program from CMD (Command Prompt). The path will show something like this “C:\Program
Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_25\bin;”. Now just add the address besides the current path directory
and save it.

The other way they can execute this program is to download the IDE (Integrated Development
Environment) on their system.

Also, we need to install PostgreSQL database which allow us to efficiently store, modify, get,
and delete required data for our project. If they don’t have it then they can download from this
below link:
https://www.postgresql.org/download/

### Configurations
After PostgreSQL installation we need to create one database user that will be used as daily
database user, also we need to create database to hold our data. After creation of database
and user, change the values of properties in hibernate.cfg.xml
